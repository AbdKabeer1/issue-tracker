/**
 * Owns robots.txt rather than letting the platform generate it (#224).
 *
 * The previous file was only Vercel's auto-injected content-signals comment
 * block: no `User-agent` rules, no `Disallow`, and no `Content-Signal`
 * directives despite the preamble describing them at length.
 *
 * Issue pages (`/<org>/<project>/<number>`) are intentionally left crawlable.
 * Link previews are a supported feature (Slack / WhatsApp / Discord unfurls
 * of shared issue links), and those crawlers do fetch the URL. Everything that
 * must not be walked - admin, settings, the API and the auth pages - is
 * disallowed here. Read access to issue pages for link-preview clients is a
 * separate, deliberate concern tracked in the User-Agent spoofing report.
